Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Deutsche Bank Women in European Business conference“Competition versus Coalition – the quest for growth?”, Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2013 Dear Ms. Siebert, Dear Mr. Leithner, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at the Women in European Business Conference organised by Deutsche Bank. The topic of this year’s conference – the quest for growth – could scarcely be more relevant for Europe today. As this audience knows better than most, the low growth environment is posing serious challenges for businesses. Uncertainty about the future is a drag on confidence and a barrier to new investment. It causes banks to cut back on lending, especially to small- and medium-sized firms, which are critical to help growth rebound. And above all, low growth is deeply affecting the lives of ordinary people in Europe. As a result, many are frustrated, and some are even desperate. They doubt whether the European strategy to deal with the crisis is the right one. They are asking: “Will we ever come out of it, with ever more cuts and austerity?”  And it is right and legitimate that they are asking this. “Power of the masses” is a key theme of this conference. We are democratic societies in Europe and these important choices about the future of our countries and our monetary union require a proper public debate.  But this debate also needs to be based on substance.  Rage alone does not solve our problems.  Just being angry at politicians or officials, even if justified, does not help citizens understand the crisis. People need to be presented with the real choices facing them – even if that means taking hard decisions or making sacrifices. Offering allegedly easy solutions, or presenting false alternatives, abandons the debate to populists and gambles with the long-term prosperity of our societies.  So today I would like to present my view on the choices that are facing Europe – and in doing so, to expose some of the myths and misconceptions about the European approach to managing the crisis. Concretely, I want to answer two questions:   First, are there alternatives to the current strategy, and if so, what are their real consequences?   Second, are we condemned to a “lost decade”, or can we find new sources of growth to lift us out of the crisis?     1. The reality of the alternatives Policy-makers sometimes speak about certain courses of action as being without alternatives – “alternativlos” as we say in German. Of course, this is not true. There always are alternatives. The question is whether they are superior, especially when assessing their likely impact and longer-term consequences.  So let me begin by looking at those alternatives. As you know, one pillar of the crisis response in Europe has been to consolidate government budgets. Progress has so far been good: the European Commission estimates that, by the end of this year, the euro area as a whole will have a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. But this progress has also had costs in the short term: growth has turned out to be lower than forecast and unemployment has risen steeply. Almost 19 million people in the euro area are currently without jobs – this includes almost one in every four young people. In the face of this hardship, the strategy of reducing deficits has come under increasing criticism from commentators and politicians. Some now urge an “exit from the austerity cage”. Others claim that, by continuing to cut deficits when growth is so low, policy-makers are ignoring the evidence, even being ideological. To exit the crisis, they say, Europe must engage in an urgent change of course: more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform. Let me be clear: I am also very concerned by the high level of unemployment. I would also like to see stronger growth. But before proposing to change course, we need to think through the consequences. This is what responsible policymaking means. And put simply, the consequence of stopping cutting deficits is to increase public debts. Is this a feasible or sustainable solution to our problems?  The real consequences of changing course In my view, the answer is ‘no’. First, regardless of its merits, such a strategy would only work if private investors were willing to finance higher borrowing at reasonable rates. And that is certainly a big “if”, especially for countries whose debts are already very high and rising. Second, it is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis. Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP. Average euro area public debt is already above that level – almost 95% of GDP –so adding more debt will only put us further into the danger zone. Third, a strategy of increasing debt simply pushes problems in to the future. Any benefits for the current generation come at the expense of future generations. Higher borrowing today means higher interest payments tomorrow – which have to be paid off with the taxes of tomorrow’s citizens. Moreover, the more today’s generation consumes, the more future generations will have to save to get the debt level back down again. And they will have to do this: as part of the new EU debt rule, all euro area countries are legally bound to start reducing their public debts below 60% of GDP. To give a sense of what this means, take the example of Italy. Public debt is almost 130% of GDP, so it will have to be more than halved by the next generation to abide by the debt limit. Around 80 billion euros a year goes on debt service – this is more than 10% of the annual budget, which is not being spent on education or infrastructure.  On top of this, future generations will face a number of hidden costs that have not yet been factored into the debt figures. These include the effects of an ageing society and the unknown consequences of a changing climate.  To take the example of Germany, the European Commission projects in its 2012 Ageing Report that the working age population will fall by more than 30% by 2060. At the same time, its age-related spending will continue to increase. This means that, year after year, there will be an ever smaller number of workers supporting an ever larger social security system.  Our obligation to future generations In other words, future generations are already carrying major burden. Is it fair to them, by increasing debt today, to make it heavier still? The economist John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed long-term considerations with the argument that “in the long-run we’re all dead”. This is true – we are, but our children and grandchildren are not. By ensuring fiscal soundness today, we represent their voice in the current debate. To sum up, I question the benefits of changing course, not because I am satisfied with the current situation, but because the alternatives available are worse. They mean placing short-term expediency over long-term sustainability – which, for me, is the opposite of responsible policy-making.  Citizens have to take decisions of great importance about their future – most directly so when they are asked to at the ballot box. By casting their votes, they make choices that will not only determine their lives, but also those of the generations to come. They deserve to have the full picture of the alternatives they are facing before they do.  2. The potential of the European strategy  But citizens still rightly ask: where will growth come from? This leads me to the second theme of my address today. Is the euro area condemned to a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment? Or are there new sources of growth we can exploit to get out of this crisis? Here, the answer depends on governments themselves. The truth is that they are not out of options when it comes to growth. There are new sources of growth that can be tapped, even while budgets are being cut. But to do so, they have to implement the other pillar of the European strategy. They have to enact deep-rooted economic reforms that increase the potential of their economies to grow. Reforms to open markets, increase competition, and remove bureaucracy. Reforms to advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help public administration actually serve the public.  These reforms are not easy to implement. They require tough choices, perseverance to confront vested interests, and patience for the effects to become visible.  Reforms as the path to growth… But their potential is huge.  To give a sense of what can be achieved, recent research from the IMF [1] finds that euro area countries could boost their GDP by more than 3% over five years by opening markets to competition and reforming tax systems.  And they could also do a lot to support growth by removing the remaining barriers to a Single Market in Europe – in particular by completing the Single Market in services.  The European Commission estimates that implementing the Services Directive – which covers activities that make up around 40% of EU GDP – could reap additional gains of 330 billion euro, or more than 2.5% of EU GDP, over five to ten years.  And this only requires implementing legislation that has already been agreed.  …and fairness Higher growth is not the only benefit from reforms: they also contribute to a social fairness. As the OECD Going for Growth 2012 report put it, this is the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms. Commentators who criticise the social consequences of the European strategy often forget this element and focus only on the effect of budget cuts – which can sometimes fall hardest on vulnerable groups in society. But well-designed reforms can have the opposite effect: they can in fact create opportunities for people on the margins of society. Let me allude to this: In Spain, there is a rigid two-tier labour market which protects insiders. This means that young people, on flexible contracts, bear the burden of an economic downturn. As a result, almost 6 out of 10 are currently unemployed. In another country, the administration of tax collection is weak which leads to enormous amounts of tax arrears. As a result, ordinary people who are taxed on their salaries have to pay more to make up the difference. These are both cases where lack of reforms leads to unfair outcomes – and so where structural reforms could help towards a fairer society. Ultimately, with structural reforms, the winners outnumber the potential losers. It is time this message gets more attention.  The never-ending race However, we should not fall into the trap of thinking that it is only struggling countries that need to take hard decisions. We are all competing today, both within Europe and with the rest of the world. There can be no sitting back, for any country. Germany was a decade ago called ‘the Sick Man of Europe’; people were wondering publicly if “Germany can be saved”. Since then, the country has become a showcase of how well-designed reforms can turn the situation around. But this example also serves as warning – others can just as quickly catch up. If struggling countries continue to pursue ambitious reforms, and Germany rests on its laurels, it could once again be this country left in the slow lane. So it also needs to tap new sources of growth, like professional services, that remain unreformed.  3. Conclusion Let me now conclude. The challenge avoiding false alternatives, and taking the hard decisions, is not a new one. Niccolo Machiavelli observed in the 16th century that,  “There is nothing more difficult to carry out than to institute a new order of things. Because the reformer has for enemies all those who have profited under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.” [2]    We at the ECB are no different: we also have structural problems to address. And since I am speaking at the “Women in European Business” conference, let me focus on one in particular: the underrepresentation of female staff in our management positions and governing bodies. For a very long time, I was personally not in favour of any kind of affirmative action, because I was convinced that qualified women would eventually make their way to the top. But I have come to realise that this is not the case – neither in the working environments I am familiar with, nor on a wider scale. I was struck when I heard that it will take more than 70 years to achieve gender-balance in the UK’s largest 100 companies if the current rate of change is maintained. [3]  The ECB’s Executive Board recently discussed enhancing gender diversity in our management and decided that, from now on, we will not only talk about diversity – we will act. All studies show that the commitment from the top is key to bringing about change. The commitment is there – we want new measures and the board has asked its Human Resources department to provide these to us. Other international financial institutions like the IMF and the EIB as well as the European Commission are more advanced and have introduced gender targets, which define specific quantitative – albeit non-binding – goals for employing women at various levels. We think that we can learn from the experience of these institutions and that their targets may serve as a benchmark for us.  This marks a significant change, especially in the generally rather conservative world of central banking. All change implies a challenge, especially for those at the top of the organisation. But leadership must be challenged to keep it relevant – which is another theme of this conference. The key issue is how, when challenged, it answers.  The current concerns about where Europe is heading are a challenge to our leadership. They have to be properly answered. Not by resorting to populism or false alternatives – but by reaffirming, clearly and honestly, why the path we are taking is the right one.  Thank you for your attention.

              "'  Is Europe on the right track?   Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Deutsche Bank Women in European Business conference“Competition versus Coalition – the quest for growth?”, Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2013 Dear Ms. Siebert, Dear Mr. Leithner, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at the Women in European Business Conference organised by Deutsche Bank. The topic of this year’s conference – the quest for growth – could scarcely be more relevant for Europe today. As this audience knows better than most, the low growth environment is posing serious challenges for businesses. Uncertainty about the future is a drag on confidence and a barrier to new investment. It causes banks to cut back on lending, especially to small- and medium-sized firms, which are critical to help growth rebound. And above all, low growth is deeply affecting the lives of ordinary people in Europe. As a result, many are frustrated, and some are even desperate. They doubt whether the European strategy to deal with the crisis is the right one. They are asking: “Will we ever come out of it, with ever more cuts and austerity?”  And it is right and legitimate that they are asking this. “Power of the masses” is a key theme of this conference. We are democratic societies in Europe and these important choices about the future of our countries and our monetary union require a proper public debate.  But this debate also needs to be based on substance.  Rage alone does not solve our problems.  Just being angry at politicians or officials, even if justified, does not help citizens understand the crisis. People need to be presented with the real choices facing them – even if that means taking hard decisions or making sacrifices. Offering allegedly easy solutions, or presenting false alternatives, abandons the debate to populists and gambles with the long-term prosperity of our societies.  So today I would like to present my view on the choices that are facing Europe – and in doing so, to expose some of the myths and misconceptions about the European approach to managing the crisis. Concretely, I want to answer two questions:   First, are there alternatives to the current strategy, and if so, what are their real consequences?   Second, are we condemned to a “lost decade”, or can we find new sources of growth to lift us out of the crisis?     1. The reality of the alternatives Policy-makers sometimes speak about certain courses of action as being without alternatives – “alternativlos” as we say in German. Of course, this is not true. There always are alternatives. The question is whether they are superior, especially when assessing their likely impact and longer-term consequences.  So let me begin by looking at those alternatives. As you know, one pillar of the crisis response in Europe has been to consolidate government budgets. Progress has so far been good: the European Commission estimates that, by the end of this year, the euro area as a whole will have a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. But this progress has also had costs in the short term: growth has turned out to be lower than forecast and unemployment has risen steeply. Almost 19 million people in the euro area are currently without jobs – this includes almost one in every four young people. In the face of this hardship, the strategy of reducing deficits has come under increasing criticism from commentators and politicians. Some now urge an “exit from the austerity cage”. Others claim that, by continuing to cut deficits when growth is so low, policy-makers are ignoring the evidence, even being ideological. To exit the crisis, they say, Europe must engage in an urgent change of course: more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform. Let me be clear: I am also very concerned by the high level of unemployment. I would also like to see stronger growth. But before proposing to change course, we need to think through the consequences. This is what responsible policymaking means. And put simply, the consequence of stopping cutting deficits is to increase public debts. Is this a feasible or sustainable solution to our problems?  The real consequences of changing course In my view, the answer is ‘no’. First, regardless of its merits, such a strategy would only work if private investors were willing to finance higher borrowing at reasonable rates. And that is certainly a big “if”, especially for countries whose debts are already very high and rising. Second, it is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis. Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP. Average euro area public debt is already above that level – almost 95% of GDP –so adding more debt will only put us further into the danger zone. Third, a strategy of increasing debt simply pushes problems in to the future. Any benefits for the current generation come at the expense of future generations. Higher borrowing today means higher interest payments tomorrow – which have to be paid off with the taxes of tomorrow’s citizens. Moreover, the more today’s generation consumes, the more future generations will have to save to get the debt level back down again. And they will have to do this: as part of the new EU debt rule, all euro area countries are legally bound to start reducing their public debts below 60% of GDP. To give a sense of what this means, take the example of Italy. Public debt is almost 130% of GDP, so it will have to be more than halved by the next generation to abide by the debt limit. Around 80 billion euros a year goes on debt service – this is more than 10% of the annual budget, which is not being spent on education or infrastructure.  On top of this, future generations will face a number of hidden costs that have not yet been factored into the debt figures. These include the effects of an ageing society and the unknown consequences of a changing climate.  To take the example of Germany, the European Commission projects in its 2012 Ageing Report that the working age population will fall by more than 30% by 2060. At the same time, its age-related spending will continue to increase. This means that, year after year, there will be an ever smaller number of workers supporting an ever larger social security system.  Our obligation to future generations In other words, future generations are already carrying major burden. Is it fair to them, by increasing debt today, to make it heavier still? The economist John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed long-term considerations with the argument that “in the long-run we’re all dead”. This is true – we are, but our children and grandchildren are not. By ensuring fiscal soundness today, we represent their voice in the current debate. To sum up, I question the benefits of changing course, not because I am satisfied with the current situation, but because the alternatives available are worse. They mean placing short-term expediency over long-term sustainability – which, for me, is the opposite of responsible policy-making.  Citizens have to take decisions of great importance about their future – most directly so when they are asked to at the ballot box. By casting their votes, they make choices that will not only determine their lives, but also those of the generations to come. They deserve to have the full picture of the alternatives they are facing before they do.  2. The potential of the European strategy  But citizens still rightly ask: where will growth come from? This leads me to the second theme of my address today. Is the euro area condemned to a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment? Or are there new sources of growth we can exploit to get out of this crisis? Here, the answer depends on governments themselves. The truth is that they are not out of options when it comes to growth. There are new sources of growth that can be tapped, even while budgets are being cut. But to do so, they have to implement the other pillar of the European strategy. They have to enact deep-rooted economic reforms that increase the potential of their economies to grow. Reforms to open markets, increase competition, and remove bureaucracy. Reforms to advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help public administration actually serve the public.  These reforms are not easy to implement. They require tough choices, perseverance to confront vested interests, and patience for the effects to become visible.  Reforms as the path to growth… But their potential is huge.  To give a sense of what can be achieved, recent research from the IMF [1] finds that euro area countries could boost their GDP by more than 3% over five years by opening markets to competition and reforming tax systems.  And they could also do a lot to support growth by removing the remaining barriers to a Single Market in Europe – in particular by completing the Single Market in services.  The European Commission estimates that implementing the Services Directive – which covers activities that make up around 40% of EU GDP – could reap additional gains of 330 billion euro, or more than 2.5% of EU GDP, over five to ten years.  And this only requires implementing legislation that has already been agreed.  …and fairness Higher growth is not the only benefit from reforms: they also contribute to a social fairness. As the OECD Going for Growth 2012 report put it, this is the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms. Commentators who criticise the social consequences of the European strategy often forget this element and focus only on the effect of budget cuts – which can sometimes fall hardest on vulnerable groups in society. But well-designed reforms can have the opposite effect: they can in fact create opportunities for people on the margins of society. Let me allude to this: In Spain, there is a rigid two-tier labour market which protects insiders. This means that young people, on flexible contracts, bear the burden of an economic downturn. As a result, almost 6 out of 10 are currently unemployed. In another country, the administration of tax collection is weak which leads to enormous amounts of tax arrears. As a result, ordinary people who are taxed on their salaries have to pay more to make up the difference. These are both cases where lack of reforms leads to unfair outcomes – and so where structural reforms could help towards a fairer society. Ultimately, with structural reforms, the winners outnumber the potential losers. It is time this message gets more attention.  The never-ending race However, we should not fall into the trap of thinking that it is only struggling countries that need to take hard decisions. We are all competing today, both within Europe and with the rest of the world. There can be no sitting back, for any country. Germany was a decade ago called ‘the Sick Man of Europe’; people were wondering publicly if “Germany can be saved”. Since then, the country has become a showcase of how well-designed reforms can turn the situation around. But this example also serves as warning – others can just as quickly catch up. If struggling countries continue to pursue ambitious reforms, and Germany rests on its laurels, it could once again be this country left in the slow lane. So it also needs to tap new sources of growth, like professional services, that remain unreformed.  3. Conclusion Let me now conclude. The challenge avoiding false alternatives, and taking the hard decisions, is not a new one. Niccolo Machiavelli observed in the 16th century that,  “There is nothing more difficult to carry out than to institute a new order of things. Because the reformer has for enemies all those who have profited under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.” [2]    We at the ECB are no different: we also have structural problems to address. And since I am speaking at the “Women in European Business” conference, let me focus on one in particular: the underrepresentation of female staff in our management positions and governing bodies. For a very long time, I was personally not in favour of any kind of affirmative action, because I was convinced that qualified women would eventually make their way to the top. But I have come to realise that this is not the case – neither in the working environments I am familiar with, nor on a wider scale. I was struck when I heard that it will take more than 70 years to achieve gender-balance in the UK’s largest 100 companies if the current rate of change is maintained. [3]  The ECB’s Executive Board recently discussed enhancing gender diversity in our management and decided that, from now on, we will not only talk about diversity – we will act. All studies show that the commitment from the top is key to bringing about change. The commitment is there – we want new measures and the board has asked its Human Resources department to provide these to us. Other international financial institutions like the IMF and the EIB as well as the European Commission are more advanced and have introduced gender targets, which define specific quantitative – albeit non-binding – goals for employing women at various levels. We think that we can learn from the experience of these institutions and that their targets may serve as a benchmark for us.  This marks a significant change, especially in the generally rather conservative world of central banking. All change implies a challenge, especially for those at the top of the organisation. But leadership must be challenged to keep it relevant – which is another theme of this conference. The key issue is how, when challenged, it answers.  The current concerns about where Europe is heading are a challenge to our leadership. They have to be properly answered. Not by resorting to populism or false alternatives – but by reaffirming, clearly and honestly, why the path we are taking is the right one.  Thank you for your attention.

              "' Dear Ms. Siebert, Dear Mr. Leithner, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at the Women in European Business Conference organised by Deutsche Bank. The topic of this year’s conference – the quest for growth – could scarcely be more relevant for Europe today. As this audience knows better than most, the low growth environment is posing serious challenges for businesses. Uncertainty about the future is a drag on confidence and a barrier to new investment. It causes banks to cut back on lending, especially to small- and medium-sized firms, which are critical to help growth rebound. And above all, low growth is deeply affecting the lives of ordinary people in Europe. As a result, many are frustrated, and some are even desperate. They doubt whether the European strategy to deal with the crisis is the right one. They are asking: “Will we ever come out of it, with ever more cuts and austerity?”  And it is right and legitimate that they are asking this. “Power of the masses” is a key theme of this conference. We are democratic societies in Europe and these important choices about the future of our countries and our monetary union require a proper public debate.  But this debate also needs to be based on substance.  Rage alone does not solve our problems.  Just being angry at politicians or officials, even if justified, does not help citizens understand the crisis. People need to be presented with the real choices facing them – even if that means taking hard decisions or making sacrifices. Offering allegedly easy solutions, or presenting false alternatives, abandons the debate to populists and gambles with the long-term prosperity of our societies.  So today I would like to present my view on the choices that are facing Europe – and in doing so, to expose some of the myths and misconceptions about the European approach to managing the crisis. Concretely, I want to answer two questions:   First, are there alternatives to the current strategy, and if so, what are their real consequences?   Second, are we condemned to a “lost decade”, or can we find new sources of growth to lift us out of the crisis?     1. The reality of the alternatives Policy-makers sometimes speak about certain courses of action as being without alternatives – “alternativlos” as we say in German. Of course, this is not true. There always are alternatives. The question is whether they are superior, especially when assessing their likely impact and longer-term consequences.  So let me begin by looking at those alternatives. As you know, one pillar of the crisis response in Europe has been to consolidate government budgets. Progress has so far been good: the European Commission estimates that, by the end of this year, the euro area as a whole will have a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. But this progress has also had costs in the short term: growth has turned out to be lower than forecast and unemployment has risen steeply. Almost 19 million people in the euro area are currently without jobs – this includes almost one in every four young people. In the face of this hardship, the strategy of reducing deficits has come under increasing criticism from commentators and politicians. Some now urge an “exit from the austerity cage”. Others claim that, by continuing to cut deficits when growth is so low, policy-makers are ignoring the evidence, even being ideological. To exit the crisis, they say, Europe must engage in an urgent change of course: more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform. Let me be clear: I am also very concerned by the high level of unemployment. I would also like to see stronger growth. But before proposing to change course, we need to think through the consequences. This is what responsible policymaking means. And put simply, the consequence of stopping cutting deficits is to increase public debts. Is this a feasible or sustainable solution to our problems?  The real consequences of changing course In my view, the answer is ‘no’. First, regardless of its merits, such a strategy would only work if private investors were willing to finance higher borrowing at reasonable rates. And that is certainly a big “if”, especially for countries whose debts are already very high and rising. Second, it is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis. Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP. Average euro area public debt is already above that level – almost 95% of GDP –so adding more debt will only put us further into the danger zone. Third, a strategy of increasing debt simply pushes problems in to the future. Any benefits for the current generation come at the expense of future generations. Higher borrowing today means higher interest payments tomorrow – which have to be paid off with the taxes of tomorrow’s citizens. Moreover, the more today’s generation consumes, the more future generations will have to save to get the debt level back down again. And they will have to do this: as part of the new EU debt rule, all euro area countries are legally bound to start reducing their public debts below 60% of GDP. To give a sense of what this means, take the example of Italy. Public debt is almost 130% of GDP, so it will have to be more than halved by the next generation to abide by the debt limit. Around 80 billion euros a year goes on debt service – this is more than 10% of the annual budget, which is not being spent on education or infrastructure.  On top of this, future generations will face a number of hidden costs that have not yet been factored into the debt figures. These include the effects of an ageing society and the unknown consequences of a changing climate.  To take the example of Germany, the European Commission projects in its 2012 Ageing Report that the working age population will fall by more than 30% by 2060. At the same time, its age-related spending will continue to increase. This means that, year after year, there will be an ever smaller number of workers supporting an ever larger social security system.  Our obligation to future generations In other words, future generations are already carrying major burden. Is it fair to them, by increasing debt today, to make it heavier still? The economist John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed long-term considerations with the argument that “in the long-run we’re all dead”. This is true – we are, but our children and grandchildren are not. By ensuring fiscal soundness today, we represent their voice in the current debate. To sum up, I question the benefits of changing course, not because I am satisfied with the current situation, but because the alternatives available are worse. They mean placing short-term expediency over long-term sustainability – which, for me, is the opposite of responsible policy-making.  Citizens have to take decisions of great importance about their future – most directly so when they are asked to at the ballot box. By casting their votes, they make choices that will not only determine their lives, but also those of the generations to come. They deserve to have the full picture of the alternatives they are facing before they do.  2. The potential of the European strategy  But citizens still rightly ask: where will growth come from? This leads me to the second theme of my address today. Is the euro area condemned to a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment? Or are there new sources of growth we can exploit to get out of this crisis? Here, the answer depends on governments themselves. The truth is that they are not out of options when it comes to growth. There are new sources of growth that can be tapped, even while budgets are being cut. But to do so, they have to implement the other pillar of the European strategy. They have to enact deep-rooted economic reforms that increase the potential of their economies to grow. Reforms to open markets, increase competition, and remove bureaucracy. Reforms to advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help public administration actually serve the public.  These reforms are not easy to implement. They require tough choices, perseverance to confront vested interests, and patience for the effects to become visible.  Reforms as the path to growth… But their potential is huge.  To give a sense of what can be achieved, recent research from the IMF [1] finds that euro area countries could boost their GDP by more than 3% over five years by opening markets to competition and reforming tax systems.  And they could also do a lot to support growth by removing the remaining barriers to a Single Market in Europe – in particular by completing the Single Market in services.  The European Commission estimates that implementing the Services Directive – which covers activities that make up around 40% of EU GDP – could reap additional gains of 330 billion euro, or more than 2.5% of EU GDP, over five to ten years.  And this only requires implementing legislation that has already been agreed.  …and fairness Higher growth is not the only benefit from reforms: they also contribute to a social fairness. As the OECD Going for Growth 2012 report put it, this is the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms. Commentators who criticise the social consequences of the European strategy often forget this element and focus only on the effect of budget cuts – which can sometimes fall hardest on vulnerable groups in society. But well-designed reforms can have the opposite effect: they can in fact create opportunities for people on the margins of society. Let me allude to this: In Spain, there is a rigid two-tier labour market which protects insiders. This means that young people, on flexible contracts, bear the burden of an economic downturn. As a result, almost 6 out of 10 are currently unemployed. In another country, the administration of tax collection is weak which leads to enormous amounts of tax arrears. As a result, ordinary people who are taxed on their salaries have to pay more to make up the difference. These are both cases where lack of reforms leads to unfair outcomes – and so where structural reforms could help towards a fairer society. Ultimately, with structural reforms, the winners outnumber the potential losers. It is time this message gets more attention.  The never-ending race However, we should not fall into the trap of thinking that it is only struggling countries that need to take hard decisions. We are all competing today, both within Europe and with the rest of the world. There can be no sitting back, for any country. Germany was a decade ago called ‘the Sick Man of Europe’; people were wondering publicly if “Germany can be saved”.

              " 'contents': '  SPEECH  Macroprudential policy in Europe: building resilience in a challenging environment   Welcome remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board, at the sixth annual conference of the ESRB Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2022 It is my pleasure to welcome you to the sixth annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).[1]  When future historians look back on our times, they may well say we lived through an era of “permacrisis”. An array of powerful shocks –  the pandemic, Russia’s unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine, and the energy crisis – have hit the global economy in quick succession.  This unstable environment poses sizeable risks for financial stability in Europe. And those risks are further heightened by a weakening economic outlook. At the same time, monetary policy is adjusting to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, and that inflation returns to 2% over the medium term. In September, the ESRB highlighted these financial stability risks by publishing a “general warning”.[2] This was the first such general warning published by the ESRB since its creation in 2010, reflecting the exceptional times in which we live. A key message therein was the crucial importance of ensuring the continued resilience of our financial system. Resilience is key in helping the financial system to deliver on its ultimate goal of supporting the real economy.  There are two facets of resilience that are vital. First, the capacity to withstand an immediate shock.[3] And second, the ability to adapt effectively to new conditions.[4] In my remarks today, I will explore these two aspects of resilience, and how we can best ensure that they are met across the financial system. After all, the history books about our present times have not yet been written. Our actions today will determine the next chapter. And I have no doubt that if all parties work together, we can master the challenges standing before us. Resilience  as the ability to withstand shocks By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities ahead of time, we can increase the resilience of the financial system, allowing it to withstand – rather than amplify – shocks.  This applies first and foremost to banks, which remain at the heart of the European Union’s financial system. They  provide around  three quarters  of credit funding from financial institutions to non-financial corporates in the euro area.[5] And thanks to sound regulation and supervision in the wake of the global financial crisis, banks have benefitted from stronger capital and liquidity buffers in recent years. That stands in sharp contrast to 2007-08, when banks’ weak balance sheets intensified the impact of the global fallout.[6]  This robust starting position explains why, when the pandemic arrived, banks were able to be part of the solution in tackling the crisis, and not part of the problem.[7] But given today’s weakening economic outlook, there are no grounds for complacency.  It remains important that banks make adequate provisions and undertake prudent capital planning. They should be attentive to credit risk and remain alert to potential flaws in their internal models as the risk environment evolves.[8]  Banks also have a key role to play in contributing to resilience by having good visibility of near-term liquidity risks and concrete plans to tackle them; strong cyber defences; and the ability to withstand fire sales and the associated mark-to-market hit on assets held on their balance sheets. If not managed properly, these are all types of risks that are particularly likely to amplify and propagate shocks through the financial system. But building resilience cannot stop at banks: non-banks also play an increasing role in the financial system.  The share of non-bank finance in overall credit from financial institutions to the real economy has increased from  around 15% to roughly one quarter since 2009.[9] If such alternative sources of finance are to work reliably, these institutions must be resilient to shocks too.[10]  The ESRB has identified several vulnerabilities among non-bank financial institutions and has asked legislators to address them.[11] One such example concerns money market funds (MMFs). MMFs are intricately connected to the rest of the financial system, including banks.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, MMFs experienced acute liquidity strains. This reflected a structural liquidity mismatch at the heart of their operations, with MMFs offering on-demand liquidity to investors while investing in more illiquid assets. Recent turmoil in the UK bond market again highlighted the importance of MMFs as cash management vehicles in the context of liquidity vulnerabilities. The ESRB issued a recommendation last December aimed at addressing structural vulnerabilities in MMFs. Swift legislative action on this front is vital, to allow non-banks to help strengthen our financial system’s capacity to withstand shocks. Resilience as adaptability The second element of resilience is the ability of the financial system to adjust to new conditions. This holds for both the system and those who oversee it.  As banks adapt to a range of technological, structural, and environmental challenges, the regulatory framework needs to adapt as well.  In March this year, the ESRB published a blueprint for how to make the EU macroprudential framework fit for the next decade.[12] It is crucial that the European Commission’s review of the macroprudential framework for the banking system be pushed ahead as soon as possible.  That is because we must contend with potentially new sources of financial stability risk. For example, one area in which the financial system is adapting to new technologies is in so-called crypto-assets and decentralised finance. Crypto-assets are exceptionally volatile and pose considerable risks to consumers.[13] After peaking in November 2021, the price of Bitcoin fell by almost 75% in the space of a year. And only last month we saw the chaotic collapse of FTX, a crypto-asset exchange once valued at USD 32 billion. While the impact of such episodes has been contained so far, systemic risk could easily arise from increasing interlinkages between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial system.  Policymakers, including macroprudential authorities, must carefully consider if and how the crypto ecosystem needs to be regulated. Europe has been at the forefront here with the agreement on the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Its swift implementation is key to closing regulatory gaps, with MiCA providing a consistent framework for crypto-asset issuance and service provision in the EU.  But this can only be a first step. From a financial stability perspective, financial regulation could be enhanced along several dimensions. For instance, sectoral financial regulation needs to address the risk from interlinkages through financial institutions’ exposures to crypto-assets. Monitoring needs to be complemented by clarity on the regulation of lending and “staking” activities.[14] And finally, market developments in decentralised finance should be taken into consideration. Conclusion   Let me conclude. Heraclitus is said to have observed that there is nothing permanent except change. And we can certainly relate to those words in an era increasingly defined by shocks to our economy. Change is at the root of why we need both a resilient financial system and adaptable supervisors. To ensure stability, the financial system needs to be able to weather rapid changes that produce shocks. And regulators and supervisors need to adapt to an ever-changing economic landscape if they are to continue to effectively safeguard the financial system. After all, unexpected crises often come from unobserved risks that were allowed to grow over time and materialise. That is why macroprudential policy must remain alert to the emergence of new challenges as and when they appear. We therefore need to encourage resilience wherever it is lacking, and adapt to change whenever necessary.  With this, I now open the sixth ESRB conference.

European Securities and Markets Authority (2022), “EU financial regulators warn consumers on the risks of crypto-assets”, 17 March.     Staking refers to the process of actively participating in crypto-asset transaction validation on a proof-of-stake blockchain. Rewards can be earned, which are akin to a source of passive income for crypto-asset holders. Policymakers must assess whether staking could be considered another source of non-bank lending, with the crypto-asset holder acting as a lender and the blockchain protocol as the borrower. See European Banking Authority (2022), “EBA provides its advice to the EU Commission on non-bank lending”, 4 May.      ',\n",
